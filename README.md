- **Platforms**: Palantir Foundry, Gotham, AWS, Azure
- **Tooling**: Git, Docker, Flex/Bison, VS Code, Google Cloud
- **Methods**: DevSecOps, Agile (SAFe), RMF/NIST compliance

## 🚀 Projects & Interests
- **Cyber Range Simulation** – Designed a virtual testbed for real-world cybersecurity training  
- **Embedded CTF (MITRE)** – Built secure firmware for an embedded door-locking system  
- **Tiny C Compiler** – Implemented a compiler from scratch using Flex and Bison  
- Exploring how **data governance and AI** can transform decision-making in classified environments
